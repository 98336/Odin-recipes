    <p>Biryani is a flavorful, layered rice dish that's a staple in the Indian subcontinent. It's made with spiced rice,
        meat or vegetables, and often includes yogurt or ghee for extra flavor. The dish is known for its strong
        fragrance and rich taste, which comes from a variety of spices, including saffron, cumin, star anise, and mace.
        Biryani is often cooked in an open fire using a leather pot, and the word "biryani" comes from the Persian word
        birian, which means "fried before cooking".
